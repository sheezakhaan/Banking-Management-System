# Banking-Management-System
Created a Python project with an integrated MySQL database, designed as a console application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The unique aspect of this project is that it doesn't require manual creation of database tables or entries via phpMyAdmin or similar tools. When you run the Python script, it automatically generates the necessary database structures.

The primary objective of this project is to streamline and simplify database management for bank employees. By eliminating the need for manual table creation, it significantly reduces the time and effort required for routine tasks.
